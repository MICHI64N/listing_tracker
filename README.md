# Listing Tracker
***Monitor E-Commerce Webpages/Listings***

This tracker is *very* early in development! The only feature added so far is to add listings to the database. However, I did implement a table class and automatic table creation, which may make future development smoother.

The command to use the feature is `python listing_tracker -a webpage`*. The only required steps from the user are to type/paste in a URL and confirm it is correct.

*\*Do not forget to replace `python` with `python3` or `py` if applicable.*
